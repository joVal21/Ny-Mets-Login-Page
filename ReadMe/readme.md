# NY Mets Login Page


The inspiration for this project is to be able to create a login page for the NY Mets webpage.

I am a fan of this baseball team and I figured it would be fun to create this for them. 

Their current login is pretty bare bones. I want to make it more Met Centric if that makes sense 



## Objectives

1. Background will be the Met logo. Probably boxed and repeated throughout
1. The login box will have a box shadow. The color will be Mets orange. I'll have to figure out the correct color code
1. User and Password will need to be required in order to submit the form.
